Are you tired of those default NPC ships? Do they look same to you? This mod should help you a bit.

This mod adds several space dungeons including:

## Friendly Ships
- Cargo Ship, inspired by in-game space stations
- Astronaut Shuttle. It's vertically-oriented because you're in space and it's weird that all other ships face the same direction.
- Novakid Train
- Deadbeat Ship
- Frogg/Agaran Merchant Ship
- Dark Cultist Ship. Don't worry, unlike Occasus cultists, they won't attack you. For now.
- Steampunk Ship
- Gnome Colony ship, escorted by a tiny (literally tiny) fleet
- Soviet Ship

## Hostile Ships
- Alternate Pirate Ships
- Penguin Flying Saucer
- Miniknog Ship
- Agaran Ship
- Alpaca Ship
- Floran Shuttle
- All-Seeing Flying Fortress
- Brainslug-infested Research Ship

## Unique Encounters
Those space dungeons are meant to be easter eggs, so they don't spawn very often. However, there you can find small stashes of rare resources and new hats.
- Rogue Satellite. A military satellite that has somehow left its orbit and now threatens everything on its way.
- House in Space. Whoever this house belongs to, they were insane enough to turn it into an improvised spacecraft.
- Giant Snow Castle. Basically, a drifting platform with a giant snow castle upon it. And lots of snowmen.
- Perfectly Generic Ship. You won't find a vessel better than this one.

## Miscellaneous
- Space Merchants! If you see a yellow ship on the map, it means you encountered one of the space merchants who would like to sell you some useful (sort of) items. So far there are 15 types of them, and even more are being worked on.
- Mecha Fighters. Rare encounters where you have to "fight" a giant battle robot piloted by a Hylotl.
- Cyberspace Ships. They can only be visited through the Spaceship Simulator that can be found aboard some friendly ships added by this mod.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
- Does this mod still work in the current version of the game?
As long as devs don't change any existing dungeon mechanics and such, this mod isn't supposed to conflict with the game.
- Is this mod compatible with Frackin' Universe?
As far as I know, it is. However, there is one bug when you enter an NPC ship and SAIL says there is no oxygen. It occurs on vanilla ships as well, so I guess it's a problem with FU, not this mod.
- What happens if I uninstall this mod?
All dungeons are based on vanilla content, so it shouldn't change anything in your game. New ships will simply stop spawning, leaving only default ships, anomalies and stations to explore.
- Is there anywhere else I can download this mod?
You can [subscribe to Steam Workshop version here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1390490083).

This is my first dungeon mod, report any bugs or issues.
